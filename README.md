# tibiamaps_explorer

A simple python script to apply a filter over the Tibia minimap files, intended to help re-explore old areas when looking for "interest points".

## How to use
Either download one of the pre-made minimaps from [Releases](https://github.com/Nezune/tibiamaps_explorer/releases) or run tibiamaps_explorer.py from the folder containing a copy of minimap folder, select one of the available modes and once finished 
copy them to your minimap location in the tibia folder (make sure the back up your minimap first!)

## Requirements
- Python 3.6
- Python modules:
    - pillow

## Special thanks to:
tibiamaps.io and all of its contributors for providing the minimaps I used for this release!
